Quantitative measurements of serum hCG is essential after evacuation of a hydatidiform mole.
In Japan, a collection of standard values of serum hCG is used to assess whether the case is good course or not.
Here is the tool to refer to these values depending on a number of weeks after evacuation.
The values other than that of week 5, 8 and 24 are an approximated value. Please see the script to know how to calculate that.

I really need any mention of these.

Thank you for your visiting.
